# Connecting ElevenLabs

To connect ElevenLabs with Streamaze TTS, all you need is your ElevenLabs API key. This can be found by clicking your profile icon in the top right of [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io) and clicking Profile. Your API Key will be displayed in a popup.

## Using the API Key

Once you have your API Key copied, go to the [Streamaze Settings](https://streamaze.xyz/settings) page and find the Donation Settings section. Switch the TTS Service to ElevenLabs and paste your API Key into the ElevenLabs API Key field.

Once this is done, press Save and reload the page. You should then be able to select a voice from the dropdown menu. All donations will now default to this TTS voice.
