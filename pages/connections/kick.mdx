# Connecting Kick

[Kick.com](https://kick.com/) is a newer streaming platform that is comparable to Twitch in its UI. You can see live subscriptions and chat messages once connected. Streamaze has first-class support for Kick, and it's easy to get started.

To connect Kick, all you need is your channel name. This is the part after `https://kick.com/` in your channel URL. For example, if your channel URL is `https://kick.com/username`, your channel name is `username`.

Once you fill in the Kick channel name, you can click "Fetch IDs from Channel Name" to fill in the rest of the fields. Press Save, and you're now completely connected to Kick! Chat messages, subscriptions and other events will now appear in your Streamaze dashboard.
