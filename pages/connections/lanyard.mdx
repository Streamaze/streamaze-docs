# Connecting Lanyard

Lanyard is a free API that we'll use to display stream information in association with a Discord account. To do this, we only need 2 pieces of information: your Discord ID and your Lanyard API key. Read the next sections to learn how to get these.

## Get Your Discord ID

To get your Discord ID, go to your Discord settings and enable Developer Mode. This is under the "Advanced" tab. Then, right click on your profile and click "Copy ID." Paste this ID somewhere safe.

### Get Your Key

1. Join the [Lanyard Discord channel](https://discord.gg/lanyard)
2. Find the Lanyard bot in the members list (Lanyard#5766)
3. Send a DM to the bot with the message `.apikey`

The response will be your API key for Lanyard. Copy this and paste it somewhere safe.

<Callout>
    This key should be <b>kept private</b>, as it allows anyone to set data in your Lanyard profile! You can generate a new one by sending `.apikey` again.
