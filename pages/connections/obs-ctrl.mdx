# OBS Ctrl

OBS Ctrl is a plugin that allows you to remotely control your OBS software from the Streamaze Dashboard. This feature is only available to [Streamaze Premium](https://my.streamaze.live/account/upgrade) users.

Early users should contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/c3RetD5r5Y) to setup this feature. We'll be rolling it out to all Premium users soon.
