# Connecting TikTok

TikTok has live streaming capabilities, and Streamaze supports their live chat and gift notifications. To connect TikTok, all you'll need is the handle (username.)

## Connecting Live Chat

To connect the TikTok live chat, go to the [Settings page](https://streamaze.live/settings) of the Dashboard and add your username to the TikTok Username field. Then, click Save.
