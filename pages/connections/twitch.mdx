# Connecting Twitch

Twitch is the most popular live streaming platform in the world. Streamaze supports Twitch live chat, bits, and subs. More Twitch features are coming soon.

## Connecting Chat

From the [Settings page](https://streamaze.live/settings) find the Chat Settings section and update the Twitch Channel Name field. Once you return to the [Dashboard](https://streamaze.live/dashboard), your Twitch live chat will be shown on the right side.

## Connecting Bits + Subs

Twitch donation notifications come through Streamlabs. As long as you've [configured your Streamlabs token](/connections/streamlabs/token) and connected your Twitch account to Streamlabs, you should be good to go.
