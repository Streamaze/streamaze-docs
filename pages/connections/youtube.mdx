# Connecting YouTube

Streamaze supports YouTube's live chat and their Super Chat feature. You'll see the chat on the right side of the Dashboard and Super Chat messages on the left side.

## Connecting Live Chat

To connect the YouTube live chat, go to the [Settings page](https://streamaze.xyz/settings) of the Dashboard and enter your YouTube channel's URL into the YouTube Channel URL field. Click Save to save your changes.

## Connecting Super Chats

We use Streamlabs to listen for YouTube Super Chats. This means all you need to do is connect your YouTube channel to Streamlabs and make sure your Streamlabs Token field is filled in. Read more about connecting Streamlabs [here](/connections/streamlabs/token).
