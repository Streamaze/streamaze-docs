# Polls

Conduct polls without pressing any buttons. "Press 1 in the chat" is enough to get things started. By opening the poll popup in the Dashboard, you'll find a bar graph containing the results of the poll.

## OBS Widget

The poll feature comes with a widget for your stream if you want to display the results to viewers. The widget will update in real time and will be hidden when the poll popup is closed.
