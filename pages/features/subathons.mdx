# Run a Subathon

> A type of livestream where every time a streamer receives a subscription—US$5 donations from viewers—more time is added to a descending timer – Wikipedia

There are solutions out there to run subathons, but nothing like Streamaze. Streamaze automatically adds time when donations or subscriptions come through. You can change the minute per dollar ratio with a few clicks, and you can keep an eye on the timer from the Dashboard.

## Start a Subathon

## On Screen Overlay

The subathon feature comes with a widget for your stream if you want to display the timer to viewers. The widget will update in real time and will display `[ENDED]` when the timer reaches zero.

We've designed the widget to be visible on any stream. You can [learn more about the widget here](/widgets/subathon).
