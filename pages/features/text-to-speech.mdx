# Text-to-Speech

With any paid plan, you can play donation messages in a custom TTS voice straight from the Dashboard. You can choose from any of the Streamlabs voices for free, or, with an ElevenLabs subscription you can enter your API key to choose an AI cloned voice. You can learn how to [connect ElevenLabs to your Dashboard here](/connections/elevenlabs).

Text-to-Speech requires the donation features which are only available to [Streamaze Subscribers or Premium](https://my.streamaze.live/account/upgrade) users.

## Create an ElevenLabs Voice

First, you'll need an account with ElevenLabs. You can create an account [here](https://elevenlabs.ai/). Once you've subscribed, you can head to the "Voice Lab" section of ElevenLabs to create a new voice using uploaded audio samples.

Once you're happen with the voice, you can navigate to the [Streamaze Settings page](https://streamaze.live/settings) and select it from the dropdown list (assuming you've provided your API key.)
