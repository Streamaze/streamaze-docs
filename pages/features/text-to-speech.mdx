# Text-to-Speech

With any paid plan, you can play donation messages in a custom TTS voice straight from the Dashboard. You can choose from any of the Streamlabs voices for free, or, with an ElevenLabs subscription you can enter your API key to choose an AI cloned voice. You can learn how to [connect ElevenLabs to your Dashboard here](/connections/elevenlabs).

## Create an ElevenLabs Voice

First, you'll need an account with ElevenLabs. You can create an account [here](https://elevenlabs.ai/). Once you've subscribed, you can head to the "Voice Lab" section of ElevenLabs to create a new voice using uploaded audio samples.

## Switching TTS Services

Navigate to the [Streamaze Settings page](https://streamaze.live/settings) and find the Donation Settings. From there, find the TTS Service dropdown and select the TTS service you wish to use.

Options:
- Streamlabs
- ElevenLabs

After selecting the service, you can choose which voice to use in the next dropdown in Donation Settings.
