# Track Profits

Want to keep track of how much you've earned/spent? We've got you covered. You can even display it to viewers with our OBS widget. Profits will always be displayed in the header of the [Streamaze Dashboard](https://streamaze.live/dashboard).

Anytime a donation/subscription comes in, we'll automatically add it to your profits.

## Expenses

By clicking on your profits in the header, you can add "expenses" to your profile. This is useful if you want to manually add or subtract from your profits. We have a growing list of currencies to choose from as well.
