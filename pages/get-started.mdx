## Your Dashboard

The [Streamaze Dashboard](https://streamaze.live/dashboard) is where you'll view your live stream chats, donations, and more. In the Dashboard you can configure your stream settings, toggle subathons, add expenses, etc. This is what you'll use to control your stream. The Dashboard can be accessed by browser or tablet as long as there's an internet connection.

## Configure Your Dashboard

To configure the information displayed on the Dashboard, go the Settings page from the sidebar and adjust the settings to your liking. The following sections break down each section of the Settings page in order.

### Streamaze Key

Go to [my.streamaze.live/account/settings](https://my.streamaze.live/account/settings) to get your key. It will be labeled "Streamaze Key" and will look something like `api-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`.

<Callout emoji="🔐">
    This key should be **kept private**, as it allows anyone to control your stream! This key will sync your dashboard settings across all your devices. Contact us if you want a new/custom one.

### Chat Settings

Connect your Twitch, YouTube, Kick, and/or TikTok channel here. Once connected, the live chats will show up in the dashboard on the right side. We have growing support for badges like members, mods, verified, and more!

### Clip Settings

Learn more about our Discord bot [here](/connections/discord-bot).

Once you've added the bot to your Discord server, you can configure the bot to send timestamps with the push of a button. **Currently supports YouTube.**

### Donation Settings

Connect the Streamlabs API to Streamaze to view your donations live! Read how to find your [Streamlabs token here](/connections/streamlabs-token). Once configured, you can use TTS features and more.

To connect Kick or TikTok donation notifications, you'll need to fill in these fields separately. Read more about [connecting Kick here](/connections/kick).

### OBS Settings

With the [premium plan](https://my.streamaze.live/upgrade), you'll gain access to our OBS plugin. This plugin allows the dashboard to control your OBS streaming software remotely.

Currently, the plugin supports:

- Starting and stopping your stream
- Switching scenes

### Stats Settings

See how many viewers you have in real-time by connecting your Twitch, YouTube, Kick, or TikTok accounts. These will be displayed in the top-right of the dashboard.

### Lanyard API

Lanyard is a helpful API that connects data to your Discord account. Once configured, you'll be able to use our OBS widgets. Read more about [connecting Lanyard here](/connections/lanyard).

<Callout>
    Because of Lanyard, it's pretty easy to create custom widgets using our data and [useLanyard](https://github.com/alii/use-lanyard). We'd love to see what you create! Contact us if you make something cool.

### GPS

By using the browser's location + Lanyard, we can display your location as an OBS widget. This is useful for IRL streamers. The GPS can be toggled on or off in the dashboard.
