### Add a Browser Source

1. Open OBS and click the "+" button in the Sources box.
2. Select "Browser" from the list of sources.
3. Name the source something like "Widget X" and click OK.

### Use the Widget URL

1. Paste the [widget URL](#widget-urls) into the URL field.
2. Play with the width and height to find the perfect fit for your scene.
3. Optionally follow the steps below to make the widget background transparent.
</Steps>

## Transparent Background

By default, OBS shows the Browser's background. You can make this transparent by adding the following CSS to the Custom CSS field in the Browser Source settings.

```css
body { background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); margin: 0px auto; overflow: hidden; }
```
