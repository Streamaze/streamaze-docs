Widgets are a way to display info on-stream to your viewers. They can be used to display information about your stream, or to interact with your viewers. We recommend using OBS (or Streamlabs OBS) to add widgets to your stream. Learn how to setup widgets in [OBS here](/obs-setup).

Below you'll find the widgets we currently provide. If you have any suggestions for new widgets, please let us know in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/c3RetD5r5Y).
