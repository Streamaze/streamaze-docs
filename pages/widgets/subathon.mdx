## Purpose

This widget is used to display your active subathon clock. [Once a subathon is started](/features/subathons#start-a-subathon) from the dashboard, the clock will automatically start counting down. When the subathon ends, the clock will show `[ENDED]` instead.

We've designed the widget to be visible on any stream; in the previews below you'll notice the widget is overlayed onto a light and dark background so you can see the contrast.
